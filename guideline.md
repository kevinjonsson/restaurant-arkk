​
*DRY
*SOLID
\*KISS
​

## Styling-CSS

​

- Use hyphen-case (-) for css-classnames
- Never style with ID
  ​

## JavaScript & HTML

​

- Single line comment with `//`, multiline with `/**/`
- camelCase for variables
- PascalCase for classes
- No abbreviations, use meaningful and explanatory names (whole words, sentences)
- Functions should do one thing.
- Max 2 parameters per function
  ​

## Files and folders

​

- Only small letters for all folders
- Dashes for files that contain multiple words
  ​

## GIT/GITHUB

​

- Commit message should be able to end the following sentence: `"This commit will..(present tense)." +name if someone else worked together`
- For longer commit messages separate the message into title and body ( ex `git commit -m "install axios" -m "name"`)
- Pull into master when we decide to do a release.
  \*Follow GIT-FLOW standard.
- Push to origin feature branch, then do a pull request on Github from develop branch, code review from other teammate
- Branch names follow gitflow. develop, feature/ + section we are working on (ex. "feature/remove-bookning").
